# Discuss Room

***1. Vision:***
- Build a solid (hopefully) online application for NTU students to have another choice to discuss in a certain private space rather than **facebook group**, which is totally annoying.
- As long as you have NTU email account, you'll be able to use this service.
 
***2. Main function in this prohect:***
- Login and register
- **Heroku** for cloud server
- main file structure for discuss room
- yet to figure out the rest of the parts...

## Installation
> As a reason of personal privacy, the steps below will be a bit tedious, not hard but detailed.

2. 
3. Postgres (Database)
